                Climate change is one of the biggest threats to life on this planet. An increase in the average
                temperatures worldwide has resulted in more frequent and intense droughts, storms, heat waves,
                and rising sea levels, all of which can directly harm wildlife and wreak havoc on people's
                livelihoods and communities. Therefore, it has become increasingly critical to monitor such events
                in order to prepare and take steps to correct the current course of climate change. This visualization
                does a good job of showcasing the heat index over a map of the United States, mainly through its use
                of an appropriate color palette. The color yellow is linked to warmth, and anyone taking a look at the
                map can intuitively grasp that darker shades of yellow/orange depict warmer temperatures without ever 
                taking a look at the key. Therefore, this visualization accomplishes its task in a clear manner without
                any scope for confusion.
