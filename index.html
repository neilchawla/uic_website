                Hi! I'm Neil Chawla. I'm a graduate student in the third semester of my program at UIC, pursuing 
                a Master's degree in Computer Science. My main interests lie in Data Analytics and Web Development. 
                Working with data and analyzing trends & insights is what drove me to pursue my Master's in this specialized 
                field after completing my Bachelor's degree. I'm from New Delhi, India, and have been living in 
                Chicago for over 5 years now as an international student. To blow off some steam, I enjoy playing 
                soccer and video games, along with exploring the city!
            </p>

            <p class="about-me">
                Over the course of my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, I have been able to build my work experience
                taking up jobs on campus. I have previously worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for CS 341: Programming 
                Language Design and Implementation for Prof. Jon Solworth (Fall '21) and Prof. Joe Hummel (Spring '22). Additionally,
                I have also worked as an Apple Certified Technician at the UIC Tech Center for over two years, where I was responsible
                for troubleshooting and repairing Apple devices.
