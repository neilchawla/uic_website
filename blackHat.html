                The map visualized above shows the murder hotspots across the country. It can be observed
                that out of all the markings, there are 8 prominent spots highlighted in red that mark areas
                with the most number of deaths caused due to gun violence. Therefore, we can conclude that gun
                violence is only a problem in those 8 spots, and the other locations are not really impacted by 
                it. Hence, avoiding those areas should greatly minimize the risk of becoming a victim of gun violence.

            <p class="about-me">
                This is a particularly deceiving graphic as it does not account for the population of the area
                before plotting the circles, which presents an incorrect outlook on the impact of gun violence on
                an area. This can lead the viewer to form opinions based on an incorrect visualization which can have
                drastic effects on their choices when it comes to determining a safe area to live. Normalizing the data
                before plotting to account for the relative population to death ratio would present a much better picture
                of the number of gun related deaths in an area.
